## ðŸ“š CS50 Week 4: Memory

### Summary
- Summary here

---
### Pixel Art
Pixels are squares that make up screens to display diffrent colours. They are arranged on a up-down, left-right grid. You can imagine an image as a map of bits where zeros represent black and ones represent white.

### Hexadecimal
RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) are numbers that represent the amount of each of these colours.

You can see from the image above that the colour is not just represented by three values. There is also a little box with a `#` next to it. This box allows you to enter a hexidecimal number to pick a colour.

Hexidecimal (base-16) is a system of counting that has 16 counting values:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
```
- 0 is represented as 00.
- 1 is represented as 01.
- 9 is represented as 09.
- 10 is represented as 0A.
- 15 is represented as 0F.
- 16 is represented as 10.
- 255 is represneted as 255.

### Pointers
C has two powerful opertators related to memory:
- & = provides the address of something stored in memory.
- * = Instructs the compiler to go to a location in memory.

```
// Prints an integer's address
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
int n = 50;
printf("%p\n"
, &n);
}
```
As you will see, `%p` shows the address in memory. `&n` is translated to "The address of `n`". this will return an address beginning with `0x`

A pointer is a variable that stores the address of something.
```
int n = 50;
int *p = &n;
```
`p` is a pointer that contains the address of an integer `n`.

```
// Stores and prints an integer's address

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int n = 50;
  int *p = &n;
  printf("%p\n", p);
}
```
This has the same affect at the previous code but takes advantage of the pointer operators.

Here is an example of using the * operator:
```
// Stores and prints an integer via its address

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int n = 50;
  int *p = &n;
  printf("%i\n", *p);
}
```
You will now see that the `printf` line prints the integer at the location of `p`.

-----
### Strings
Now we have an idea of pointers, we can take another look at strings:
```
// Prints a string

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  string s = "HI!";
  printf("%s\n", s);
}
```
Recall that a string is simply an array of characters. For example, here is `s = "HI!"` represented as such:

However, what is `s`? Well, this whole time you have been using CS50 header for string, what is actually happening is `s` is a pointer that is pointing at the first byte in the string in memory, then the the code is printing until it finds the `\0`.

<img src="/Week-4-Memory/Notes/Images/hello-memory.png" alt="Memory representing hello" width="300px">

We can see this in code by doing:
```
// Prints a string's address as well the addresses of its chars

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  string s = "HI!";
  printf("%p\n", s);
  printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
  printf("%p\n", &s[1]);
  printf("%p\n", &s[2]);
  printf("%p\n", &s[3]);
}
```
Here is how you set a sting without the CS50 header:
```
// Declares a string without CS50 Library

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  char *s = "HI!";
  printf("%s\n", s);
}
```
