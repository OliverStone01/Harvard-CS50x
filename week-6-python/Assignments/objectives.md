### Hello, Again
In a file called hello.py in a folder called sentimental-hello, implement a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints hello, so-and-so, where so-and-so is their provided name, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Except that your program this time should be written in Python!

### Mario Less
In a file called mario.py in a folder called sentimental-mario-less, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be written in Python!

### Mario More
In a file called mario.py in a folder called sentimental-mario-more, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be written in Python!

### Cash
In a file called cash.py in a folder called sentimental-cash, write a program that asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. You can do this exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written in Python, and you should assume that the user will input their change in dollars (e.g., 0.50 dollars instead of 50 cents).

### Readability
Write, in a file called readability.py in a folder called sentimental-readability, a program that first asks the user to type in some text, and then outputs the grade level for the text, according to the Coleman-Liau formula, exactly as you did in Problem Set 2, except that your program this time should be written in Python.

### DNA
DNA, the carrier of genetic information in living things, has been used in criminal justice for decades. But how, exactly, does DNA profiling work? Given a sequence of DNA, how can forensic investigators identify to whom it belongs?

In a file called dna.py in a folder called dna, implement a program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs.
