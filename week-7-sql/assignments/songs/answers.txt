Acording to Spotifs Website, here are the Aura colours and what each means.

- Purple: This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained,
          and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.

- Green: Calm, analytical, and introspective are the traits that describe a green aura.
         These listeners gravitate toward complex music to tame their fast-moving minds.

- Pink: Often described as the hopeless romantics of the aura spectrum, pinks view the world with a sense of optimistic,
        childlike wonder.

- Orange: Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.

- Yellow: Yellows like their music to align them to the goals of their day, fueling their need for focus,
          motivation, and self improvement all while reducing any nerves that could get in the way.

- Blue: Blues are wistful or emotional, and this hue reflects listeners who seek out music to feel their feelings out loud.

When running:
sqlite> SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

the return value was:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

based on this, the user could still be the following for the following reasons:
Purple: "Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving" which would link to the Danceability and a mid to high energy score.

Yellow: "like their music to align them to the goals of their day". This could link to the energy as they are looking for motivation.
        and the same goes for the danceability.

But I think the most likely of them all would be:
Blue:   "Blues are wistful or emotional" This links to all 3 sections. having a mid level valence could be due to the song choise based on
        their mood. Energy is also near the middle which could indicate that some days they want high energy and others not so much.



The problem with this solution is someones pump up song for example could be a fast (high energy) and danceability to it but also has sad lyrics.
As you see above, I struggled to decide on which Aura to give the user as 3 of the 6 auras matched fairly well.

hypetheticaly, I could create a scoring system which would check all 3 retruned values and give you an aura by doing something like:

If energy < 0.50 AND valence < 0.50 AND danceability < 0.50;
Aura = Green

If energy > 0.70 AND valence > 0.70 AND daceability > 0.70
Aura = Organge
