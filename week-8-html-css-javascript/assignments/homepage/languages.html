                    <h1>Scratch</h1>
                    <p>Scratch is a basic visual programming tool great for learning the fundamentals. It helped me understand by being able to
                      drag and drop elements without the need to worry about syntax.

                    <p>
                      For the project, we were tasked with creating a game. I took the lessons from week 0 about 8-bit and
                      bytes and how to calculate them, and made a game that took an image of the Harvard stage and turned on and off the lightbulbs by updating the image to
                      represent a binary number, and the user had to input the answer. The user had to answer 3 correct answers and then the difficulty would increase by adding more lightbulbs.
                      The binary was also randomly generated, and the user was only given 3 lives to give the correct answer.

                <h1>C</h1>
                <p>C was a great introduction to syntax and writing actual code. This was my favourite language due to the
                  style and complexity. C is a great language as it is relatively secure and allows you to learn the fundamentals that make
                  up other languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had to complete multiple projects for C, such as cash, where I had to create a cash register function that calculated the amount of change required to give back to the customer,
                   depending on how much was given and what was purchased.
                  This was a great experience and gave me an amazing feeling when writing and testing my own code.

              <h1>Python</h1>
              <p>Python is an interpreted language. It goes through each line of code and interprets what you want the code to do.
                Python is a great language for creating almost everything and is very popular. Python also loses some of the syntax
                from C, making it less likely to return a syntax error due to user error.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem set for Python was difficult. I had to create an input that accepted a CSV file containing STR and a
                second text file containing DNA sequences. My program then had to count each match into memory and keep count of each match to the DNA sequence. Then print the
                name of the matching individual.

          <h1>SQL</h1>
          <p>SQL, short for Sequal, is a language used for working with databases. It can also be used with Python to create
            automatic systems for collecting/writing data. I enjoyed SQL as I found the syntax and layout to be easy to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            SQL's problem set was also one of my favourites during the course. I was given Databases that had acquired data about
            a robbery. It was my job to use those databases to collect data and find out who the thief was and where they had escaped to.
            as well as who the accomplice was.

        <h1>HTML/CSS</h1>
        <p>HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is used to create websites. CSS is it's counterpart also known as a styling language.
          I have enjoyed working with both HTML and CSS as parts of the syntax from C are back, and I also enjoy watching my project come together
          as I write the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML/CSS is how this entire website was created and is, in fact, my project for this week's problem set. With the help of Bootstrap,
          we were tasked with creating a homepage that must contain 4 pages and a little bit about myself. For my 4 pages, I did a homepage,
          a Quiz on all these languages, a page about all the languages I've learned, and a contact me page.

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is used for automating and creating working parts of a website, such as how my quiz checks each answer
          and keeps track of your score and then prints a different response depending on how you did. JavaScript was also part
          of this week's HTML problem set.
