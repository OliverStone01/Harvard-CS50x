### Inheritance
A person‚Äôs blood type is determined by two alleles (i.e., different forms of a gene). The three possible alleles are A, B, and O, of which each person has two (possibly the same, possibly different). Each of a child‚Äôs parents randomly passes one of their two blood type alleles to their child. The possible blood type combinations, then, are: OO, OA, OB, AO, AA, AB, BO, BA, and BB.

For example, if one parent has blood type AO and the other parent has blood type BB, then the child‚Äôs possible blood types would be AB and OB, depending on which allele is received from each parent. Similarly, if one parent has blood type AO and the other OB, then the child‚Äôs possible blood types would be AO, OB, AB, and OO.

In a file called inheritance.c in a folder called inheritance, simulate the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.

#### Implementation Details

Complete the implementation of inheritance.c, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.

- The create_family function takes an integer (generations) as input and should allocate (as via malloc) one person for each member of the family of that number of generations, returning a pointer to the person in the youngest generation.
  - For example, create_family(3) should return a pointer to a person with two parents, where each parent also has two parents.
  - Each person should have alleles assigned to them. The oldest generation should have alleles randomly chosen (as by calling the random_allele function), and younger generations should inherit one allele (chosen at random) from each parent.
  - Each person should have parents assigned to them. The oldest generation should have both parents set to NULL, and younger generations should have parents be an array of two pointers, each pointing to a different parent.

### Speller

For this problem, you‚Äôll implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

#### Background
Theoretically, on input of size n, an algorithm with a running time of n is ‚Äúasymptotically equivalent,‚Äù in terms of O, to an algorithm with a running time of 2n. Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., n in this case, since n could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that 2n feels twice as slow as n.

The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By ‚Äúfastest,‚Äù though, we‚Äôre talking actual ‚Äúwall-clock,‚Äù not asymptotic, time.

In speller.c, we‚Äôve put together a program that‚Äôs designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called dictionary.c. (It could just be implemented in speller.c, but as programs get more complex, it‚Äôs often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in dictionary.c itself but in dictionary.h instead. That way, both speller.c and dictionary.c can #include the file. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you!
